5/11/15,Tesco,"Yoghurt not collecting, this is due to all yoghurt categories being placed at level 3 whereas scrapy goes down to level 4 to collect",Collect for each yoghurt type separately under the same category (seems to work). Also as there should be to two category's of yoghurt I've split the categories approriately,Increased number of routes to maintain. A try and except for the third layer would be better( but more complicated than I am able to do at the moment)
