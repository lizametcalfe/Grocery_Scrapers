,We have set out a series of COICOP classes that we are interested in scraping. And a ,,,,,
,selection of items within the class which make a up a significant proportion of the weight ,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,The next complexity is figuring out the key search words to scrape the chosen items ,,,,,
,We have gone with the strategy of keeping the categories broad; hence capture a broad sample (say the first two/three pages?),,,,,
,then filter the collected data (based on key words from the more detailed COICOP item description),,,,,
